1. Get my Recipe Project ! 


2. Project Description

The application allows the user to generate a cooking recipe list based on the ingredients and the difficulty chosen. The dashboard shows different widgets:

- SidebarPanel :  The user can select options there
- Ingredient list : The user can see his/her options selected
- Table recipe : the final output, the user can see the recipe list

If the user is not satisfied with the output, he/she still has the possibility to reset and start over. 

In order to to get this dashboard we used Shiny package for convenient purposes. 


We encountered a few limitations : 

- the filtering of the recipes in not 100% right 
- We wanted to add a button to each row of the DataTable output to let the user click on it and 2 new widgets will show up display the image and the description of the recipe selected. 



3. How to Install and Run the Project

To run the project you will need to install the package .... 


4. How to Use the Project

While the app is on, the user has the possibility to select different ingredients and the difficulty level. He/she  needs to click on the button "add" to register the selected ingredient and finally click on the button 'Get my recipe ! ' to generate the list of recipe. 

If the user want to start over and generate new recipes, he/she has to click on the button 'Reset'.
